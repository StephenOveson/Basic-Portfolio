                    <p>My name is Stephen Oveson and I am a fullstack developer. I have spent multiple years in technical support handling everything from servers to smart homes. Through the course of my time in technical support I have gotten to know and love all kinds of technology, but what I enjoy most is programming and creating using that technology. I began my love of technology when I was just young with the help of my father I learned different softwares, hardwares, and other technologies. I have been able to do all this thanks to the wonderful support of my family.</p>

                <p>I have experience not just in technical support, but in other things such as coaching. I have worked as a coach for the past couple years particularly as an esports coach for a game called League of Legends. Using what I know I have worked with multiple teams; helping them understand strategy, gameplay, and teamwork. Constantly, I have been in the top 2 of the amateur scene, traveling around the country for different tournaments.</p>  
                <p>Other experiences through my life include a mission where I spent two years in Brazil learning portuguese and teaching the people of Santa Catarina about Jesus Christ. I have acheived my Eagle Scout rank through the Boy Scouts of America program. I have taught myself multiple musical instruments including guitar, piano, ukelele, and bass.</p>
